# My First Project: Olympus Clone Site

This is my life's first project, and I'm excited to share it with you! As a beginner, I don't know everything, but I've managed to create a clone site of Olympus using only HTML and CSS.

# Note: 
This is a clone app, just a project, and not an official Olympus website.

# Important: 
Please note that this site is not responsive and is only optimized for laptop and PC screens. I'll work on making it responsive in the future, but for now, it's best viewed on a larger screen.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far, and I hope you enjoy exploring this project. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me!

## How to Use

To use this project, simply follow these steps:

1. **Download all the files**: Download all the files in this repository and place them in **one folder**.
2. **Run the HTML file**: Open the `Olympus Project.html` file in your web browser to view the Olympus clone site.

**Important:** Make sure to keep all the files, including images, in the same folder. Since all the code is **inline** (not external), separating the files or images will break the code.

That's it! I hope you enjoy exploring this project. If you have any feedback or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me!
